## ðŸ”— Hosted APIs

All the API Codes have been uploaded to the repo with their respective folder names.

- https://creative-api-141459457956.us-central1.run.app/generate_creative - For creative generation according to the payload given.
- https://flask-api-141459457956.us-central1.run.app/remove-background - To use cloud vision API for object detection for masking of images
- https://logo-integration-api-141459457956.us-central1.run.app/integrate_logo - Uses Pillow and other libraries to inteagrate logo with a base image according to user preference.

## **Features**
- **User Input**: Upload an image and provide additional details via a user-friendly web interface.
- **Image Generation**: 
  - The uploaded image and details are sent to an API that generates a creative poster.
- **Cloud Storage**: 
  - The generated poster is uploaded to **Google Cloud Storage**.
  - The **image URL** is retrieved from Google Cloud.
- **Mask Generation**:
  - The image URL is sent to another API to generate a mask for the poster.
  - The mask is used to refine and customize the generated poster.
- **Logo and Mask Integration**:
  - The mask is applied to the generated poster.
  - A logo is added to the masked poster to finalize the design.
- **Output**:
  - The final masked and logo-integrated poster is displayed and/or available for download.

## **Workflow**

1. **User Input**:
   - The user uploads an image and provides additional details via the Streamlit app.

2. **API for Poster Generation**:
   - The uploaded image and user-provided data are sent to a **Poster Generation API**.
   - The API generates a creative poster.

3. **Google Cloud Storage**:
   - The generated poster is uploaded to a **Google Cloud Storage bucket**.
   - The **public URL** of the uploaded poster is retrieved.

4. **Mask Generation API**:
   - The poster URL is sent to a **Mask Generation API**.
   - The API returns a mask for the poster.

5. **Final Poster Creation**:
   - The mask is applied to the poster.
   - A logo is added to the masked poster to finalize the design.

6. **Display/Download**:
   - The final poster is displayed on the app and can be downloaded by the user.
